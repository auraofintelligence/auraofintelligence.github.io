/*
 * The courses: the data behind the hub at courses/index.html and each
 * course page. Add a course here and the hub card appears automatically,
 * grouped under its `family` (the hub renders tracks in the order families
 * first appear below).
 *
 * Shape:
 *   {
 *     id:        "slug",              // becomes courses/<slug>.html
 *     title:     "Course title",
 *     family:    "Track label",       // groups the card on the hub
 *     blurb:     "One or two sentences, in the build-your-own voice.",
 *     links:     [ { label, href } ],
 *     generator: true|false,          // does this course carry a working md builder?
 *     videos:    [ "YouTubeID", ... ],// avatar-presented short videos (TBC until recorded)
 *     livestream:null
 *   }
 *
 * The Local track draws on the real Minjerribah project family (see the
 * Strange but True community ledger). Not every project is a course; these
 * are the ones that teach a repeatable, buildable skill. Videos and live
 * streams launch empty on purpose; the blurbs and links are real today.
